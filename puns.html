<div class="paragraph2main"> <h3>The key to making skeleton puns is timing and word placement. You must wait for the perfect oppurtunity
 to implement something. Once you have a chance and you know what to do, do it. You must use either something bone related or with parts of the word skeleton.
 For example:</p>
 <P> "This website took a TON of work. A skele-TON!"</p>
 <p> A flawless Skeleton joke.</h3></p>
